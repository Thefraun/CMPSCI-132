# Program 1.4 / HW 4
# Due Date: April 10, 2025
#
# Description: This program accepts command line arguments specifying
# whether to perform linked list operations or conversion and
# evaluation of an operation, given in infix notation, and performs
# the required operations.
#
# Acknowledgement:
# I based my implementation of infix to postfix conversion and
# evaluation of a postfix operation on the algorithm provided in
# the class notes.
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

To Run: In terminal, use the command "python3 calculator.py" and then the keywords
of the desired operations.

Implementation: To create a stack, I utilised a doubly linked list. With this stack,
I was able to effectively implement and utilise the algorithms provided to us in class
to convert an infix notation to postfix notation and evaluate the resulting postfix notation.

Additional Notes: This was written in Python 3.11.9, and while in my tests it worked in
Python 3.10.11, it is possible that there will be errors in 3.10.11 due to version
compatibility issues.
