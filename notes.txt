a = [1, 2] is list
b = list(a) creates new list, but mem values of indexes point to same as a
a = a + [3, 4] re-assigns mem value, but a+=[3, 4] extends a
arr = [[1,2,3][4,5,6][7,8,9]] -> arr points to 100, [1,2,3] points to 200, [1] points to 300, so on

tuple is ordered, immutable version of a list

string is immutable sequence of characters
its elements are located in contiguous memory space

set is a collection of unique, unordered, immutable elements
set is mutable, but elements are immutable
set is based on hash table
a = {1, 2}
b = {2, 3}
a | b = {1, 2, 3}
a & b = {2}
a - b = {1}, b - a = {3}
a ^ b = {1, 3}
a.isdisjoint(b) == False
a.issubset(b) == False
a==b == False
a!=b == True
a = b changes pointer of a to b

dictionary is a set of distinct key to associated value
a = {key: value}
key has to be immutable, value can be any
a[new key] = new value appends new k, v pair into a

logical operators: and, not, or

equality operators: is, is not, ==, !=
is, is not checks memory location (immutable objects with same values are equal(only if initialised with same value, not if changed to have same value))
==, != checks value

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a[1:3] -> [2, 3]
a[1:4:2] -> [2, 4]
a + [6] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
a * 2 -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

yield statement keeps function running, essentially a return without breaking

fp = open('a.txt', 'r')
a = []
for line in fp:
    for word in line.split():
    v = int(word)
    a.append(v)
fp.close()

Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a theoretical concept and model for data type where data types are defined by behaviour
ADT is defined in terms of data (or value), operations on data, behaviour of operations

Information hiding is a concept of separating internal detail from the other parts of by providing an interface
Information that is likely to change, including internal data structure and its implementation, is commonly hidden

If private value is in the same class, can be accessed by another var in the class
__iadd__ handles +=, __add__ handles +

__slots__ is a special class attribute, which restricts creating a member var(attr)
It reduces memory usage and improves performance
Cannot create any new self. vars in the class other than specified by __slots__

class Node:
    __slots__ = ['data', 'next']
    def __init__(self, data, next=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next

Linked list has two main parts: head and tail
If the linked list has 0 elements, head and tail point None

Double linked list has head and tail

On test, must implement queue First, Dequeue with tail as first element of queue

To utilise a stack in order to find/error check delimiters:
while there are delims:
    d = next delim
    if d is open delim:
        push(d)
    else:
        t = pop()
        if t match d:
            report
        else:
        error

Infix notation 3 + 2, Postfix 32+
Infix (3 + 2) * 4, Postfix 32+ 4*
Infix 3 + 2 * 4, Postfix 3 24* +
Infix (3/5) + (2 * 4), Postfix 35/ 24* +
3 + 2 * 4 - 5, 3 24* + 5 -

On test, will have to implement linked list, make stack with linked list, solve problem with stack (i.e. calculating postfix equation)

Preorder traversal bin tree (VLR) -> Current, left, right
Inorder (LVR) -> Left, current, right
Postorder (LRV) -> Left, right, current

Breadth first -> Go across first, then down when reached end of row
